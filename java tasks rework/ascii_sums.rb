# Write a program which will accept a single pair
# of strings separated by a comma; the program should
# calculate the sum of ascii values of the characters of
# each string. The program should then subtract the sum of
# the ascii values of the second string from the sum of the
# ascii values of the first string.
#
# Suppose the following input is given to the program: 
#
# 123ABC,456DEF
#
# Then the sum of the ascii values of the characters
# in '123ABC' is 348 and in '456DEF' it is 366. The Difference
# between these numbers is 348 – 366 = -18 
# The corresponding output to be printed by the program is: 
#
# -18
